// Need one giant grid square split into 4 squares evenly
// Then those squares split into 4 squares evenly
// Then those squares split the same way to make a 16 x 16 grid

// Do we need to make every single div 16 times?
/* Is there a way to shorten the code using math & a function to 
create the grid for us?*/

/* Worst case: one div with four divs inside it & each of those divs
have four divs inside those until we get to 16 x 16 */
